iPic.uploadImage(imageFilePath, handler: { (imageLink, error) in    
	if let imageLink = imageLink {
		// Image uploaded
	   
	} else if let error = error {
		// Some error happened
	}
})
```

Upload image data:

```swift

let imageData = try! Data(contentsOf: imageURL)

iPic.uploadImage(imageData, handler: { (imageLink, error) in    
	if let imageLink = imageLink {
		// Image uploaded        
	   
	} else if let error = error {
